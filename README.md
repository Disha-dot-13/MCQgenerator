The Automated MCQ Generator is an AI-based application that generates multiple-choice questions from PDF or text documents. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) orchestrated with LangChain and runs locally using Ollama, eliminating the need for API keys or paid services. The system automatically creates MCQs with multiple options, identifies correct answers, and provides a brief review of quiz difficulty. Designed for educational use, the project offers a cost-free, offline, and privacy-friendly solution for automated question generation
